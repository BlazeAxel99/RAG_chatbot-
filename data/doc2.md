## Introduction to Vector Databases

Vector databases are designed to store and search embeddings generated from text or other data types.
They are essential in semantic search and retrieval tasks in AI.

### Popular Vector Stores

- **FAISS**: Developed by Facebook, great for fast similarity search.
- **ChromaDB**: A lightweight and easy-to-use vector database.
- **Weaviate** and **Pinecone**: Cloud-native vector stores for scalable production use.

These tools are critical in RAG-based applications where we need to match queries with relevant document chunks.
