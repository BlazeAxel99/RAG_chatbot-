LangChain is a framework for building applications with language models. 
It simplifies chaining LLM calls and connecting them with external data sources like APIs or files.

LangChain supports tools like OpenAI, HuggingFace, FAISS, ChromaDB, and many more. 
It is commonly used to build chatbots, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, and autonomous agents.

LangChain also provides document loaders, text splitters, embedding tools, and vector stores for semantic search.
